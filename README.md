# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 and TypeScript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

### What TODO?

- displaying all needed api data - 
- adjusting styles to match the mockup, for example added "Add to favourites" button on position absolute
- 

I didn't use external api, because in cors settings only allegro domain is allowed
